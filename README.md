# financial_news_web_scraper
A web scraper which extracts text from financial articles on Reuters' and Forbes' websites, and feeds them into a postgreSQL table using the psycopg2 module.

## Getting Started
It is recommended that a virtual environment is created. Download the modules listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage
1. Create a new folder in the working directory called 'raw_webpages'. Move the csv files into this folder.

2. Fill out the database_details.py file with the appropriate information. This will require an existing database to connect to, as well as a user profile.

3. Run scraper.py. This will prompt the user to confirm whether an existing postgreSQL table *with the correct columns* already exists (essentially checking if this script has been run before). If no such table exists, a new one will be created (scraper.py will prompt the user to define the table name). 

Note: scraper.py will also write the scraped data to the csv files in the raw_webpages folder to allow quick viewing of the information with a module such as pandas. The scraped information includes the following:

- *Date* that the articles were written/uploaded
- *Category* of the articles such as 'Fintech', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Markets', 'Investing' etc.
- *Title* of the articles
- *Summary*
- *Full text*
- *URL*
